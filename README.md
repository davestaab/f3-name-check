# F3 Name Check

This is a tool to quickly check availability of a new F3 nickname for FNGs. Open the website on your phone during the Name-o-Rama and type in the nickname you want to use. You will see if the name is available or taken.

## How does it work

F3 Name Check works by checking the tags used in back blasts. It assumes you use pax nicknames as tags on BackBlasts and this is a reasonably accurate representation of F3 names used in your city/region. 

This has some advantages.
* No authentication is required to check nicknames
* No person info is shared on the public internet (real name, email, etc)
* We can see the number of times the PAX has posted and how recently.

## Disclaimer

This may not be an accurate list of nicknames. If you use tags in your back blasts that are not nicknames it will be less useful. If new names are not added as tags they won't show up in the list. If PAX members aren't tagged on BBs the meta info won't be accurate (number of posts, and most recent post).

This should be fairly obvious once you understand how it works.

## Can I use this in my region

Short answer is yes, probably. See [How does it work](#how-does-it-work) and [disclaimer](#disclaimer). Submit an issue [here](https://github.com/davestaab/f3-name-check/issues/new) with details, and we can get it setup.
